    "The diffusion coefficient of the drug is highly related to the stability of the amorphous solid dispersion. Typically, a higher diffusion coefficient of the drug implies a higher molecular mobility, promoting them to rearrange into ordered or amorphous domains within the polymer matrix. This has an effect of reducing the solubility of the drug formulation"
